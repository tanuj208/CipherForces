# Algorithm Explanation

In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest â€“ typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.

# Problem Statement

You are given a Ciphertext and you need to find the plaintext which on encryption will produce this ciphertext. You will also be given access to our encryption server which will use same parameters to encrypt your plaintext as the original one. In addition, we also specify that length of the plaintext is 5.
Ciphertext: aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d

# Access
You have access to the encryption server.

# Solution
Bruteforce search on plaintext
Answer = hello
