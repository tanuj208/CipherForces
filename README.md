# CipherForces

CipherForces is a Learning Platform for various Security Schemes where one can learn by experimenting (OJ for POIS). It is a Web app for hosting security challenges where the student can interact with different security
schemes. A Prehosted set of Challenges spanning from Ancient Ciphers to Advanced Ciphers covering concepts covered in POIS course have already been uploaded to the Web app.

# Features
  - Ability to host Problem Statements
  - Upload security algorithms
  - User specified Server Interface Access (SIA)
  - Solve Challenges
  - Keeping track of the Attempts and Successes
  - Play around with Common Security Algorithms
  - Number of attempts and success of each algorithm.

# Users
  - Teaching Assistant : 
    - Interface for Uploading Challenge 
    - Ability to use custom codes with limited interaction ability
    - Uploading Algorithms for free interaction
  - Student : 
    - Browse through chapters
    - Interact with uploaded challenge codes
    - Solve Challenges
    - Keep track of attempts and successes

# How to Run

To run, clone the directory, then type the following commands, inside the cloned directory.

For flask app - 

```sh
$ cd flask_app
$ export FLASK_APP=__init__.py
$ flask run
```
