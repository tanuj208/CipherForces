# Algorithm Description

Each character in alphabet space (lowercase & uppercase ascii characters) are mapped to a random other character in the same space. Each character of plaintext is replaced by its mapping to create ciphertext. Characters not in given alphabet space are left as it is.

# Problem Statement
You are given the ciphertext - GI QikIiIk RJX iIbahCi NiICEFCXv. qlQ IbbX XaDDrXJkI aM, RCXR NiQlDX, CDk vlQ XviJMX QF NCjQD. GI jQDvJDaIk vQ hQQE Cv vRI wIDa lQDkIiJDb JF vRJX lQahk NI vRI kCr RI CkkIk XQwIvRJDb DIl. qRJX lCX ChXQ MCiv QF vRI iQavJDI.

You are required to find the corresponding plaintext.

# Access
You can look at the code but you do not have access to encryption or decryption server.

# Solution
Frequency Analysis
Ans = He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new. This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all. It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years.
